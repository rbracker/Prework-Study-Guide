# Readme

## User Story

As a bootcamp student,
I want the prework notes to be structured on a webpage,
So that I can easily find and read the information.

## Acceptance Criteria

Given the prework project respository,
When I view the README for the repository,
Then I can see a professional README that provides information on the project and how to use it

# <Prework-study-guide>

## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

- What was your motivation?
I joined this bootcamp to better financially provide for me and my daughter.
- Why did you build this project? (Note: the answer is not "Because it was a homework assignment.")
I know that doing this will better my skills as a coder.
- What problem does it solve?
Research, and understanding of coding.
- What did you learn?
I learned that coding can be a long process and sometimes one typo can make your code not work. Its best to take a break and come back to your code, or if possible have someone come and take a look at your code too.

## Table of Contents (Optional)

If your README is long, add a table of contents to make it easy for users to find what they need.

- [Installation](#installation)
- [Usage](#usage)
- [Credits](#credits)
- [License](#license)

## Installation

What are the steps required to install your project? Provide a step-by-step description of how to get the development environment running.

I followed the steps the module provided and read and reread everything when I came across an issue.
It felt over whelming at first, but then I got the hang of it. 

First I built made my respitory in git hub
then made my README File and created issues to help keep me on track

After I created and built a css code. CSS helped in styling the webpage to make it look more aesthetically pleasing. As well as easy to read.

Lastly I made the javascript, which I don't think I understand fully just yet. But, I am very motivated to learn more about it through this course.

## Usage

Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed.

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative file path, add it to your README using the following syntax:

![alt text](assets/images/screenshot.png)

## Credits

List your collaborators, if any, with links to their GitHub profiles.

If you used any third-party assets that require attribution, list the creators with links to their primary web presence in this section.

If you followed tutorials, include links to those here as well.

## License

The last section of a high-quality README file is the license. This lets other developers know what they can and cannot do with your project. If you need help choosing a license, refer to [https://choosealicense.com/](https://choosealicense.com/).

üèÜ The previous sections are the bare minimum, and your project will ultimately determine the content of this document. You might also want to consider adding the following sections.

## Badges

Badges aren't necessary, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## Features

If your project has a lot of features, list them here.

## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute to it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.

## Tests

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.
