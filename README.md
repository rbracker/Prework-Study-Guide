# Readme

## User Story

As a bootcamp student,
I want the prework notes to be structured on a webpage,
So that I can easily find and read the information.

## Acceptance Criteria

Given the prework project respository,
When I view the README for the repository,
Then I can see a professional README that provides information on the project and how to use it
